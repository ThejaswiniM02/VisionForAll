# VisionForAll
Final Year Project - Real-time Color Detection and Color Blindness Simulation with Chrome Extension for Web Accessibility
# VisionForAll

VisionForAll is a computer vision project aimed at detecting dominant colors from a live webcam feed and providing tools to simulate color blindness for better accessibility.

## What’s Completed

- Real-time dominant color detection from webcam video frames.
- Display of detected dominant color as a solid rectangle with RGB values.
- Initial backend implementation using OpenCV and KMeans clustering.
- Implemented color blindness simulation filters (e.g., protanopia, deuteranopia,tritanopia).
- Chrome extension for color blindness simulation on web pages.

## What’s To Be Done

- Develop a Chrome extension for color blindness accessibility on web pages (recoloring of web pages using filters).
- Improve UI/UX for better user interaction.
- Add support for processing static images in addition to webcam feed.
- Optimize performance and add error handling.
- Write comprehensive tests and documentation.

## Features (Planned)

- Real-time dominant color detection.
- Color blindness simulation for different types of color vision deficiency.
- Easy-to-use interface for color accessibility testing.
- Cross-platform support and deployment.
